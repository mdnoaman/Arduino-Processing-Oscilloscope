# Arduino-Processing-Oscilloscope
Budget oscilloscope using Arduino and processing

This arduino oscilloscope project was inspired and based on these codes https://gist.github.com/chrismeyersfsu/3270358#file-gistfile1-c
and https://gist.github.com/chrismeyersfsu/3270419#file-gistfile1-c.

The project is devided into two parts:

In the first part, the Arduino code (ard.ino file) is loaded into the Arduino (I used UNO, others can also be adapted). The program analog reads
the value from 4 Inputs. This number can be scaled up. These 10 bit long values corresponding to each channel are devided into two 5 bit long bytes.
This way, individual bytes have first three 0 bits, i.e: 000XXXXX, where X is the data bit. The reason, I do this is to keep those free (three) bits for other type
of communication, such as synchronizing the data start point or encoding channel information, etc. In this case, I am sending an additional 
byte before the analogread values, i.e. Serial.write( B10100000 ). I am randomly using the first three bits for a start trigger.

On the processing side, the singal serial data is read continuously. When the port.read() finds this matching byte, (B10100000 or 160 in dec), 
the variable "state" changes to 1 which in turn runs the other routine where all the 4 channels values are read and decoded. The rest part of the code
plots these values along with showing a current value for each channel on top. A typical screenshot is taken for the window in the .png file
